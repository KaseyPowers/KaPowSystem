/**
 * Combat Notes:
 * 
 * Attack Rolls:
 * - Instead of AC for odds of hitting + doing damage. 
 * - Roll to hit has a DC based on how difficult it is to hit the target. (TBD how blocking with a weapon will work. aka perry reactions or not)
 * Armor, Shields, Etc. will act to reduce the incomming damage. Effects that occur on touch will have rules around if they are blocked by armor. 
 * 
 * Combat Class notes:
 * 
 * Focused on how one approaches fighting, each class can be treated more of a root prerequisite to a group of elements
 * 
 * Shouldn't have any limitations for professions/magic. (although there can be combinations that have better or worse synergy) 
 * 
 * - Brawler: Speed for offense and being hard to hit
 * 
 * - Knight: Balanced speed with defense, with focus on protecting others.  
 * 
 * - Tank: Slow and Sturdy, Big hits
 * 
 * - Marksman: Focus on Ranged combat and making space. 
 * 
 * - Support: Little to No ability to fight directly, but helps others instead. 
 * 
 * - Fighter: Instead of mastering fighting styles, focus is on mastering weapons. Can learn a larger variety or master some to a greater degree than other combat classes.
